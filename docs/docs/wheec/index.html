    <h1>WheeC and The WheeC Engine</h1>
    <h2>Understanding WheeC</h2>
    <p>WheeC is a process of turning Whee code to C code.</p>
    <p>Then, the C code gets executed.</p>
    <p>This will allow users to easily modify the code while being blazingly fast.</p>
    <h2>The WheeC Engine</h2>
    <p>A WheeC Engine will do what WheeC needs to do: Turn Whee to C.</p>
    <p>The default WheeC Engine that comes with Whee is whee-to-c.</p>
    <p>You can try it any time by running:</p>
    <code>whee-to-c [script].whee</code>
    <p>Which will output the C code with the top line being "=== Generated C Code ===" to ensure that it is a valid WheeC Engine.</p>
    <p>You can try modifying it's code by putting a file wheeinit/required.c</p>
    <p>You can also try adding wheeinit/optional.c if isn't essential</p>
    <p>Modules will use wheeinit/modules/[module]/[optional/required].c</p>
